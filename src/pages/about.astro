    <!-- Our Mission -->

        <Headline id="mission" direction="left">Our <span class="text-orange">Mission</span></Headline>
        <p>Since our program begin, our mission has been to serve children and families from the Upper Peninsula who are battling childhood cancer. We believe that when a child is sick, the entire family is affected. Our support focuses on the individual along with the entire family.</p>
        <p>The Childhood Cancer program provides grants to families to minimize the financial hardship that is directly attributable to their childâ€™s diagnosis. This includes needs for travel, medical and household bills.</p>
        <p>We rely solely on donations from private benefactors, sponsors, Lions Clubs and other community organizations, foundations and fundraisers. Every dollar earned goes directly to the families and to the programs that serve them.</p>

    <!-- Our Cause -->
    <Group>
        <Headline id="cause" direction="left">Our <span class="text-orange">Cause</span></Headline>
        <p>Lions Clubs International has adopted Childhood Cancer as an initiative on a global level. Each year, more than 300,000 children are diagnosed with cancer across the world.<Reference href="#cause-ref-1">[1]</Reference> This means that a child is diagnosed with cancer every 2 minute.<Reference href="#cause-ref-1">[1]</Reference> The Lions have been exploring new ways in which Lions can help children with cancer in our own communities.</p>
        <p>Michigan is ranked 5th in the nation for annual number of pediatric cancer diagnoses. 470 children are diagnosed in Michigan each year.<Reference href="#cause-ref-2">[2]</Reference> Our program has connected with 65 families in the U.P. The Upper Peninsula has the largest number of children per capita diagnosed with cancer in Michigan.<Reference href="cause-ref-2">[2]</Reference> U.P. families face daunting challenges because they must travel out of our area for care. Many times, one parent is forced to take an extended leave of absence or leave a job to be with their child. Medical treatment can go on for many years, leaving kids with physical, emotional, and sensory deficits.</p>
