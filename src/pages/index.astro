            470 children are diagnosed in Michigan each year, and the Upper Peninsula has the largest number of children per capita diagnosed with cancer in the state.

            U.P. families face daunting challenges because they must travel out of our area for care. Many times, one parent is forced to take an extended leave of absence or leave a job to be with their child. Medical treatment can go on for many years, leaving kids with physical, emotional, and sensory deficits.
