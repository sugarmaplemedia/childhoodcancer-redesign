                    His father is very grateful for the assistance as Rylan received treatment at the University of Michigan hospitals in Ann Arbor, including surgery, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and more. This treatment required lengthy hospitalizations, keeping Rylan and his mom away from his father and siblings for months.

                        Within the past few decades, cancer research has produced promising treatments for pediatric cancer. 60% of children who have had cancer, have lifelong emotional, cognitive, physical, and developmental deficits. Key statistics for Childhood Cancers, The American Cancer Society's most recent estimates and statistics for cancer in children in the United States can be found here. <strong>Currently in the U.S., the recovery rate for childhood cancer is 84%.</strong>
